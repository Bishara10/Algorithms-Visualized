# Algorithms-Visualized
Python implementation of graph traversal and pathfinding algotirthms, and their visualization via PyGame.

## Overview
  This project visualizes pathfinding algorithms on an n Ã— m grid, aiming to find a path from the top-left cell (0, 0) to the bottom-right cell (n, m). The grid includes random walls that block movement, and traversal is allowed only in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The grid is converted to an adjacency list to represent them as a graph, which will be used by the algorithms.
Visualization is handled using PyGame, with each cell rendered as an adjacent rectangle on the screen.
