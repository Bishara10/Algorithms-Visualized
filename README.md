# Algorithms-Visualized
Python implementation of graph traversal and pathfinding algotirthms, and their visualization via PyGame.

## Overview
  This project visualizes pathfinding algorithms on an ***n*** Ã— ***m*** grid, represented as a 2D array (rows and columns), with the task of finding a path from the top left cell in the grid `(0, 0)`, to the bottom left cell `(n, m)`. The grid includes randomly generated walls that the algorithms cannot traverse. Movement is limited to the four cardinal directions: up, down, left, and right. To facilitate traversal, the grid is converted into an adjacency list representing a graph, which will be used by the algorithms.

Visualization is handled using PyGame, with each cell rendered as an adjacent rectangle on the screen.
